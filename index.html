	<h1>Frontend Web Dev</h1>
	<header>
		Frontend Web development has three major components to it:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>HTML</strong></li>
			<li><strong>CSS</strong></li>
			<li><strong>JavaScript</strong></li>
		</ul>
	</header>

	<div id="HTML">
		First, lets talk about the HTML. This is what gives structure to any sort of webpage. It makes the foundation or the <strong>bones</strong> that the whole page can stand on. It helps separate sections in a webpage that separates the various contents from one another.
	</div>

	<div id="CSS">
		Then there is CSS. This is what gives decoration to the structure of HTML. It is the <strong>skin</strong> to the <strong>bones</strong> of HTML.
	</div>

	<div id="JavaScript">
		Finally, we have JavaScript. It finally gives <strong>life</strong> to the whole page by turning it from a static webpage to a interactive web application.
